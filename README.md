The software will be developed using Java and the SWING UI library. The architecture of the system is designed in a modular fashion, where each module represents a major component of the software. The main module is responsible for handling the user interface and communication with the other modules.

Other major components of the system include the shape library, polygon editor, and the drawing module. The shape library is responsible for providing different types of shapes in various colors, while the polygon editor allows children to draw custom polygons. The drawing module allows children to visualize the shapes they have drawn and interact with them.

### User Interface Design

* The user interface design was developed using low and high-fidelity prototyping techniques. The low-fidelity prototype was used to test the basic layout and functionality of the interface, while the high-fidelity prototype was used to test the visual design and user experience.\

* The interface design is simple and intuitive, with a minimalist design that focuses on the content. The shapes and colors are visually appealing to children, which encourages them to engage with the software. The UI also includes an interactive help feature that guides the children through the different steps of drawing shapes.

### User Testing and fine tuning

* As part of the design phase, user testing was conducted to evaluate the software's effectiveness and identify any potential issues. The user testing involved a sample of 20 primary school children, ranging from the ages of 6 to 9 years old. The participants were invited to use the software and were asked to complete various tasks related to drawing shapes.\

* The user testing was conducted in a controlled environment, and consent forms were obtained from parents or legal guardians of the participants. The testing was done using a mix of observation and interview techniques to gain feedback from the children.\

* The feedback from the user testing was used to identify areas for improvement in the software. The most significant issue identified was that some of the children found it difficult to draw polygons using the polygon editor. As a result, the polygon editor was redesigned to be more user-friendly and intuitive.

User testing was conducted to identify any issues with the software, and the feedback received was used to improve the design. The next phase of the project will be the implementation phase, where the software will be developed according to the design specifications.\
\
In conclusion, the design phase of the software project was a critical phase that ensured the software met the requirements of the primary school children. The user interface was designed with the user's experience in mind and tested using low and high-fidelity prototyping techniques.\

The implementation phase is a crucial step in the software development process, where we bring the design of the software to life. In the case of children's educational software, it is important to ensure that the implementation phase considers the needs and preferences of children, and makes the software intuitive, interactive, and engaging.

To ensure flexibility and adaptability during the development process, we will follow the Agile methodology, which emphasizes frequent communication, collaboration, and flexibility. This approach allows us to make changes as necessary based on feedback from the client and users, ensuring that the software meets their needs and requirements.

To implement the software, we will use Java programming language and the SWING user interface (UI) library. The system architecture is designed to be modular and flexible, with separate components responsible for different tasks. The major components of the system are:



<details>

<summary>Shape Editor</summary>

The Shape Editor component is responsible for creating, editing, and deleting shapes. It includes functionality to set the dimensions of the shape, visualize it in 2D and 3D, and add shading and color.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Shape Database</summary>

The Shape Database component stores all the created shapes and allows users to save and load shapes as needed.

</details>

<details>

<summary>User Interface</summary>

The User Interface component is responsible for displaying the software's functionalities to the user. It provides an interactive, intuitive interface that meets the user requirements.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Shape Detector</summary>

The Shape Detector component is responsible for detecting shapes in real-time using computer vision techniques. It is optional and can be used to enhance the user experience.

</details>

We have designed the software to be modular and flexible, with separate components responsible for different tasks. This approach ensures that the software is scalable and can be easily modified or extended in the future. The major components of the software are the Shape Editor, Shape Database, User Interface, and Shape Detector.

The Shape Editor component is responsible for creating, editing, and deleting shapes. It includes functionality to set the dimensions of the shape, visualize it in 2D and 3D, and add shading and color. The Shape Database component stores all the created shapes and allows users to save and load shapes as needed. The User Interface component provides an interactive, intuitive interface that meets the user requirements. The Shape Detector component is optional and can be used to enhance the user experience by detecting shapes in real-time using computer vision techniques.

The components interact with each other using well-defined APIs. The User Interface component interacts with the Shape Editor component to create, edit, and delete shapes. It also interacts with the Shape Database component to save and load shapes. The Shape Editor component interacts with the Shape Database component to store and retrieve shapes.

During the implementation phase, we will use version control software such as Git to manage code changes and ensure consistency. We will also use automated testing tools to ensure that the software is of high quality and meets all the requirements.

Overall, the implementation phase is critical to the success of the software, and we will ensure that the software meets the needs and preferences of children, is intuitive and engaging, and is flexible and scalable for future modifications and improvements.
